Estela was currently taking her degree in Biotechnology @ Universitat de Vic, Catalunya, Spain. Estela volunteered her time to help demo the project at Embedded World in Germany and did an amazing job on and off the stand throughout the whole week. Her knowledge / expertise in medical research was a valuable asset to the demonstration and the project as a whole. Through her involvement in the project, Estela is now also part of the Intel Software Innovator Program and has since represented the team/project at Intel Developer Affinity Day at Intel's IoT Lab in Munich Germany.

Intel Software Innovator Oyinlola Oluwatobi from Nigeria also assisted with booth duty during the event, speaking with visitors and talking bout thr project. Tobi (Oyinlola) was at Embedded World as a speaker and has a very inspiring story behind the work he is doing in Africa. Working with the German government, Tobi is piloting a Pay-As-You-Cook system that will allow Rwandan locals to pay only for the gas they use whilst cooking, making gas more available and reducing the requirement to use charcoal.

The event was an amazing success, the team was able to present the project and talk about the story behind the project to the public, Intel staff, AI/ML/DL researchers and students. The team had an amazing position at the Intel booth and had many people visit to find out what we are doing.
